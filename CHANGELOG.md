# Changelog

What changed in this fork, newest first. Upstream Godot's own changes are in its release notes.

Every pull request adds a line under **Unreleased**, in one of: Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed. Write what changes for someone using the engine, in one line, with the PR number. The release workflow publishes the Unreleased entries as the release notes and moves them under that release's heading.

## Unreleased

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md: release notes come from its Unreleased entries, and pull requests are checked for one (#73).

### Fixed
- CodeQL scans run to completion: a push to `main` waits behind a running scan instead of cancelling it (#77).

## build-57db5e08 (2026-11-05)

### Fixed
- Linux arm64 release build used an x86_64 Python (#71).

## build-c28b7788 (2026-11-05)

### Added
- Linux (x86_64, arm64) and macOS (universal, raster only) editor builds in each release (#66, #67).
- CodeQL scan of the C++ sources (#67).

### Changed
- Releases are built on GitHub Actions: on demand, and every Monday when `main` has moved (#65).
- CI actions pinned by commit to their latest releases, least-privilege tokens, Dependabot for action updates (#68).

### Fixed
- Path tracer: storage images declared with their textures' formats (#70).

### Removed
- Upstream's CI workflows and unused composite actions (#67).

## build-c7e111a0 (2026-11-05)

### Fixed
- Crash when resizing the window: the screen pass drew past the swap chain image (#64).

## fixes-85b5084a (2026-11-05)

First release.

### Added
- `RenderingDevice.get_video_memory_budget()` and `get_video_memory_usage()` (#62).
- `RenderingServer.is_pathtracing_ready()`; path tracer pipeline variants compile on a worker with a SPIR-V disk cache (#59).

### Changed
- Path tracer samples textures with raster's mipmap bias and ray-cone gradients (#55).
- Path tracing with Ray Reconstruction draws `blend_mul` transparents over the output (#56).

### Fixed
- Editor help no longer runs doc work after the editor is freed (#60).
- Vulkan device fault reports kept when the driver returns VK_INCOMPLETE (#52); deviceFault feature enabled before use (#40).
- WorkerThreadPool releases task Callables before scripting languages finish (#48, #50).
- ClassDB default property value cache guarded for worker threads (#46).
- PrimitiveMesh builds surface arrays on the CPU instead of reading them back (#44).
- Path tracer gives custom shaders the mesh's UV2 (#42).
