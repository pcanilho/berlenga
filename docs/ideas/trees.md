# Procedural trees, shrubs and deadwood

Research note, 10 Nov 2026, written before any code. Scope: every woody form from hazel and
hawthorn size up: trees, saplings, multi-stem shrubs, hedges, standing dead trees (snags),
fallen logs and broken branches. Everything below about 1.5 m (herbs, ferns, grasses, dwarf
shrubs, brambles) stays with `PlantGenerator` ([vegetation.md](vegetation.md), grass.md).
Placement, canopy shade and the weather canopy map already exist in `VegetationField3D` and
`PlantSpecies`; the trees made here replace the stand-ins placed there today.

The bar: dense forests that hold up at 100% crop under both raster and path tracing, move
realistically in the weather wind, take snow, and scale to an open world (hundreds of
thousands of trees, streamed).

## 1. How trees are modelled: the algorithm families

**Parametric, rule per branch level.** Weber and Penn, *Creation and Rendering of Realistic
Trees*, SIGGRAPH 1995: per level, length, taper, curvature, split rate, down angle, rotation
and gravity. Fast and controllable, used by Blender Sapling, Arbaro, EZ-Tree, gdTree3D and
SpeedTree's rule generators. Weakness: the crown is the sum of rules, not of competition, so
crowns look regular, interior branches never die, and a tree does not react to neighbours,
walls or light.

**Grammar based.** L-systems (Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer, *The Algorithmic Beauty of
Plants*, 1990), and positional information (Prusinkiewicz et al. 2001, which `PlantGenerator`
already follows for herbs). Ideal for small plants with regular phyllotaxis; for big trees
the grammar becomes the same hand-tuned rule set as Weber-Penn.

**Space colonization.** Runions, Lane and Prusinkiewicz, *Modeling Trees with a Space
Colonization Algorithm*, 2007. Attraction points fill a crown envelope; each point pulls the
nearest bud; points are consumed as branches reach them. Natural gaps and competition between
branches, shape set by the envelope. Weakness: the envelope is drawn, not grown.

**Self-organizing growth (the botanical standard).** Palubicki et al., *Self-organizing Tree
Models for Image Synthesis*, SIGGRAPH 2009. Buds compete for space and light (marker points
or a voxel shadow grid), resources flow down from the leaves and back up by the
Borchert-Honda model with an apical-dominance parameter, branches that stay in shade are shed.
Crowns, interior gaps, dead lower limbs, forest-grown versus open-grown shapes and lean
toward light all emerge. Follow-ups:
- Stava et al., *Inverse Procedural Modelling of Trees*, CGF 2014: a developmental model with
  about 24 biologically meaningful parameters (apical dominance, phototropism, gravitropism,
  shedding, branching angles) and a fit of those parameters to an example tree. Gives a species
  table we can fill from botany.
- Pirk et al., *Plastic Trees*, SIGGRAPH 2012: re-shape a finished tree to a new environment
  (wall, neighbour, light) without regrowing.
- Pirk et al., *Windy Trees*, ToG 2014: branch stress from wind (sigma = 4cM / 3 pi r^2,
  break when above d^3 p), and rest pose slowly following the long-term wind: wind-shaped
  crowns at coasts and tree lines.
- Makowski et al., *Synthetic Silviculture*, SIGGRAPH 2019: the same growth model drives both
  tree shape and the ecosystem, few parameters per species.
- Li et al., *Rhizomorph*, SIGGRAPH 2023 (vigor-based plant graphs, shoots and roots).

**Strand-based volumetric trees.** Li et al., *Interactive Invigoration: Volumetric Modeling
of Trees with Strands*, SIGGRAPH 2024: every leaf tip sends a strand down to the root; strands
are packed per cross section (PBD), and the bark surface is extracted from the packed strands.
Junctions, root flare, twisted and fluted trunks come out right without any junction code.
Cost: 3 to 13 s per tree for profiling plus 3 to 10 s meshing (RTX 3090). Li et al., *Stressful
Tree Modeling: Breaking Branches with Strands*, SIGGRAPH 2025: Cosserat-rod XPBD on the same
strands gives bending, breaking and splinters, 21 to 108 ms per tree per step: offline or
hero-only. No public code found for either.

**Commercial and production tools (bar setters, not usable).**
- SpeedTree 10: generators (trunk, branch, frond, leaf mesh, batched leaf, vine, decal) driven
  by rules, forces and "shade pruning"; 10.1 adds seasons. Games wind: shared sway, one or
  two independent branch levels (bend, oscillation, turbulence, flexibility, independence),
  leaf ripple, gusting with rise and fall, response times scaled by mass.
- Unreal 5.7 Procedural Vegetation Editor (experimental): a node graph over a skeleton
  (trunk, branch generators, gravity and phototropism bends, leaf placer), exports a Nanite
  static mesh or a skeletal assembly. Natsura (Houdini) does growth simulation upstream of it
  (Grow, Split, Repeat nodes, run by a Simulate solver) and exports Nanite assemblies.
- The Grove (Blender and Houdini): botanical growth with shade shedding, the closest
  commercial match to Palubicki.

**Godot ecosystem (checked).** EZ-Tree port and gdTree3D are Weber-Penn style with
vertex-shader sway. Cosmo Tree Gen (MIT, GDScript, WIP, 22 commits) makes low-poly trees with
no LOD, bones or wind; it stays parked. Zylann's tree generator plugin is old and unmaintained.
None meets the bar or reaches the path tracer with its wind.

## 2. Meshing: bark, junctions, leaves

- **Generalized cylinders** along each branch with parallel-transport frames are the norm
  (SpeedTree, Sapling, PVE). The weak spot is the junction: child tubes poke through the
  parent. Fixes, in rising quality: weld child into parent with a collar (SpeedTree), smooth
  convolution or implicit junctions (Bloomenthal 1985, Lluch et al. 2004), or strands (Li 2024).
- **Bark detail must be geometry where the camera is close.** Path tracing rejects normal-map
  only detail in silhouettes and contact shadows. Real bark ridges near the camera (displaced
  tessellation or displaced mesh LOD 0), normal maps farther. Procedural bark patterns: Lefebvre
  and Neyret, *Synthesizing Bark*, EGWR 2002 (fracture of an expanding bark layer); Dale et
  al., *Bark Fracture*, 2014. Moss and lichen by up-facing and wind-side wetness, which the
  climate maps already provide.
- **Leaves: real geometry near, alpha clusters far.** The Witcher 4 forest demo (Unreal Fest
  2025) uses no alpha-tested foliage at all: cards were 3 to 4 times slower in Nanite, and a
  fully modelled tree costs 63 MB against 6 MB for a carded one. Under path tracing alpha costs
  any-hit work on every ray: Indiana Jones went from 7.9 to 3.6 ms TraceMain with opacity
  micromaps (any-hit samples 17% to 3%). Our answer: modelled leaves (shared shape and texture
  baker from `PlantGenerator`) on near LODs, leaf clusters as cards with OMMs on mid and far
  LODs, which the fork already bakes.
- **Leaf optics:** thin-leaf transmission and back lighting are in the fork; leaf colour by
  season (SpeedTree 10.1 seasons) gives autumn, and bare winter crowns let snow sit on twigs.

## 3. Wind

- **Vertex-shader layers** (Sousa, GPU Gems 3 ch. 16; Horizon Zero Dawn: distance to trunk,
  distance to branch and per-branch phase baked in vertex colours; SpeedTree games wind; God of
  War's "boneless" sway on a 3D wind field). Cheap, but invisible to the path tracer: shadows
  and reflections would show a still tree.
- **Physically guided hierarchy.** Habel, Kusternig and Wimmer, EG 2009: each branch a tapered
  Euler-Bernoulli beam, deflection u(x) = c2 x^2 + c4 x^4, a damped oscillator per branch with
  resonance f = 2.55 L^-0.59 Hz (broadleaf; about 2.5 times higher leafless) driven by a Kaimal
  style wind spectrum through precomputed noise textures, one per hierarchy level; parents
  deform children. 0.1 ms for 1,500 branches on 2009 hardware. Diener et al. 2009 (modal
  wind projection basis) is the alternative per-branch response.
- **Bones, evaluated on the GPU (current state of the art).** Unreal 5.7 Dynamic Wind moves
  bones, not vertices. The Witcher 4 forest: 500,000 trees, 28 species, about 135,000 animated
  bones in view, one compute thread per bone accumulating to the root in about 0.1 to 0.3 ms
  (under 20 us on async compute); 150 unique skeletons with 8 orientation variants instead of
  one skeleton per tree; rigid skinning (one bone per part). Vertex wind was rejected because
  it inflates Nanite cluster bounds, the same reason it breaks BLAS bounds for us.
- **Breaking and permanent bend:** Pirk 2014 stress; PhysX for snapped branches and felled
  trees.

The fork already has the delivery path: `MultiMesh.bones_per_instance`
([multimesh-instance-bones.md](multimesh-instance-bones.md)) skins instanced trees from
per-instance bone records, raster and path tracer match (mean pixel difference 0.013), and a
compute pass can write the records (gpu-multimesh-records.md). What is missing is the solver.

### 3a. The solver we build (stage 3)

Wind on a tree is a structure loaded by turbulence, the problem wind engineers solve for
towers and bridges in the frequency domain: the load spectrum times the structure's transfer
function (Davenport, *The application of statistical concepts to the wind loading of
structures*, Proc. ICE 19, 1961). Shinya and Fournier (*Stochastic motion: motion under the
influence of wind*, Eurographics 1992) and Stam (*Stochastic dynamics: simulating the effects of
turbulence on flexible structures*, Eurographics 1997) brought it to graphics: each mode of a
plant is a damped oscillator, and its motion is the turbulence spectrum filtered by that
oscillator. de Langre (*Effects of wind on plants*, Annu. Rev. Fluid Mech. 40, 2008) reviews the
mechanics this rests on.

`WeatherMap3D` already synthesises its gusts as Kaimal-weighted plane waves under Taylor's frozen
turbulence: each wave has a wave vector and so a frequency, omega = k U. A linear oscillator's
steady response to one wave is exact: the wave scaled by |H(omega)| and delayed by its phase,
H = 1 / (1 - (omega/omega0)^2 + 2 i zeta omega/omega0). So every bone's motion is a closed-form
sum over the same waves the grass and the clouds see. No state, no time step: it is
deterministic, it never blows up at a frame hitch, any instance can be solved on any thread or
on the GPU, raster and the path tracer read one pose, and the whole forest stays coherent (a gust
front visibly rolls through the stand because the waves' phases depend on position).

1. **Rig, from the grown branch graph.** Rigid parts, as in The Witcher 4: trunk (and each
   basal stem) split into up to four segments with linear blending across the joints; then
   the thickest limbs, whose parent is already a bone, down to about 2 cm radius; at most 48
   bones a tree, one root bone. Every internode, twig, leaf and spray takes the bone of the
   nearest boned axis below it.
2. **Bone mechanics.** Each bone is a cantilever spring at its base. Rotational stiffness
   k = 3 E I / L with I = pi r^4 / 4 at the bone's base (green-wood modulus E about 8.5 GPa;
   Forest Products Laboratory, *Wood Handbook*, 2010). Inertia J sums the wood (green density
   about 900 kg/m3) and foliage (about 0.2 kg per m2 of leaf, fresh) of everything the bone
   carries about its pivot, so omega0 = sqrt(k / J). Checked against measured trees: sway
   frequencies of 0.15-0.8 Hz for mature trunks, rising with diameter over height squared
   (Moore and Maguire, *Natural sway frequencies and damping ratios of trees*, Trees 18, 2004),
   and several Hz for limbs. Damping ratio about 0.1 for trunks with foliage, 0.15 for limbs
   (same review; most of it is aerodynamic).
3. **Load.** Drag on the bone's subtree, F = 1/2 rho Cd A |U| U, applied at the centroid of
   that drag area, with A the frontal area of wood and foliage the bone carries. Foliage
   streamlines as the wind rises, so Cd falls as U^B above about 4 m/s, Vogel's exponent
   B of about -0.7 for broad leaves and -0.5 for needles (Vogel, *Drag and reconfiguration of
   broad leaves in high winds*, J. Exp. Bot. 40, 1989). The quadratic drag is linearised about
   the mean wind at the bone (the quasi-steady gust load of Davenport 1961): a static bend from
   the mean, and a gust part that passes through the oscillator.
4. **Turbulence: background plus resonance.** Davenport's gust loading splits a structure's
   response in two, and so does the solver. The background part is the weather's own waves
   (8 log-spaced Kaimal bands per axis, up to a few Hz at moderate wind), each passed through
   the bone's quasi-static gain, so a gust front sways the whole stand together. The resonant
   part is what a lightly damped oscillator does with the broadband load near its own
   frequency: a narrow-band sway of variance S_F(f0) pi f0 / (4 zeta k^2), with S_F the Kaimal
   load spectrum at f0. It is drawn as two waves at f0 (1 +- zeta) with phases hashed per bone
   and per tree, which gives the beating envelope such a response has, along and across the
   wind (across-wind sway of trees is of the same order; de Langre 2008). Mean wind is the
   weather's at the bone's height (log law, canopy and lee shelter, gust patches).
5. **Pose.** Each bone turns about its pivot by theta = (c x F) / k (the moment over the
   stiffness), clamped to 0.5 rad, and carries its children. Records are written into a
   MultiMesh with `bones_per_instance` (placement times the bone chain), so raster and the path
   tracer skin the same pose. Trees past `wind_range` keep their rest pose.

The CPU solver runs over worker threads and is the reference; a compute version of the same sum
is the step for forest scale on the PC (one thread per bone, as in The Witcher 4). The colliders
and touch bending of section 7a add a contact moment to the same bones.

## 4. Far trees and open-world scale

- **Billboards and impostors** (Horizon: top LODs are cross planes; God of War: card clusters
  and billboard clouds; octahedral impostors in many engines) fail under path tracing: they show
  as flat cards in shadows and reflections.
- **Stochastic pruning.** Cook, Halstead, Planck and Ryu, *Stochastic Simplification of
  Aggregate Detail*, SIGGRAPH 2007 (Pixar): at distance, drop a random subset of leaves and
  enlarge and darken the rest so area and contrast are kept. Appearance-preserving and ray
  traceable, so it suits a path tracer.
- **Clustered LOD plus OMM, partitioned TLAS.** van Antwerpen, Gautron, Biddulph, Kubisch,
  Schmid and Stich, *Real-time Path Tracing of Massive Dynamic Foliage*, ACM 2026: partitioned
  TLAS, automatic clustered LOD, OMMs replacing twigs, needles and leaf clusters at distance,
  per-plant animation with screen-space-bounded error, tens of millions of plants. RTX Mega
  Geometry and OMMs are what The Witcher 4's ray-traced forest uses. Our route: mesh LODs per
  tree (twig pruning, fewer sides, leaves to clusters) shared through the RT LOD and persistent
  slot work ([open-world-geometry.md](open-world-geometry.md), [instanced-forests.md](instanced-forests.md)),
  Mega Geometry later on the PC.
- **Voxels** (Nanite Foliage, 4x4x4 bricks for sub-pixel clusters) and prefiltered volumes
  (Loubet and Neyret, *Hybrid Mesh-Volume LoDs*, EG 2017) are the far-far answer; a later
  stage, and it overlaps with the voxel stand-ins already noted for vegetation.

## 5. Shrubs, hedges, the in-between forms and deadwood

- **Shrubs** are the same growth model with basitonic dominance: many stems from the base,
  each short-lived and replaced (hazel, hawthorn, elder, willow scrub, juniper, dwarf pine
  krummholz at the tree line). In Stava's parameters this is apical dominance low plus basal
  bud activation.
- **Saplings and age classes** come free from growth: stop the simulation earlier. One species
  gives seedling, sapling, pole and mature variants, which forest edges and clearings need.
- **Hedges** are shrubs grown inside a clipped envelope (space colonization markers only
  inside the hedge volume, pruning of buds outside it), like Palubicki's topiary examples.
- **Deadwood.** Standing dead trees and logs follow the five decay classes used in forestry
  (Maser et al. 1979; Mellen and Ager 2002): class 1 twigs and bark intact, 2 twigs lost, 3
  bark sloughing and top broken, 4 only stubs and a soft stem, 5 a fragmented stump. Each is a
  post-process of a grown tree (drop leaves, then twigs, then bark, break the top), so snags
  and logs match the living species around them. Shade-shed branches from the growth model
  give dead lower limbs on living conifers. Fallen logs and broken branches become PhysX
  bodies; stumps and logs feed the snow and wetness shaders like any other mesh.

### 5a. As built (stage 4)

- `TreeGenerator.decay_class` 1-5 applies the classes above to the grown tree: 1 drops broad
  leaves but keeps a conifer's needles, gone red-brown (the red stage of beetle-killed spruce and
  pine, shed in the second or third year), 2 the twigs under 1.2 cm, 3 the limbs under 3 cm and snaps the top at 55-85% of the
  height (a splintered break of pale wood), 4 leaves limb stubs of 15-50 cm on a stem broken at
  30-60%, 5 is a stump of 0.4-1.5 m. Bark weathers grey, then to pale and darkening wood.
- `fallen` lays it on the ground as a log; limbs that would reach into the ground break off, and
  on a decayed log the ones standing up have rotted off too.
- `envelope` clips growth to a box (shoots leaving it are cut back each year), for hedges and
  topiary; a clipped hawthorn keeps its full leaf count inside the box.
- Every stand (`make_stand`) now carries the regeneration and deadwood of its leading tree:
  saplings (a fifth of the age, half the spacing, tolerating deep shade) at density 0.6, snags
  (classes 2-4, 2.5x spacing) at 0.25 and logs (classes 2-4, felled) at 0.4, placed by the
  lead's own climate rules. Hedgerows have no lead and get none.

## 6. What the games at Paulo's bar do

- **Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2** (CryEngine): Warhorse has published no vegetation talk; what
  is known is CryEngine's toolset (painted and rule-placed vegetation, layered vertex bending,
  touch bending of physicalized branches, mesh LODs then billboards). From the game itself, the
  look comes from species variety and botanically right forest structure (age mix, deadwood,
  undergrowth, forest edges), not from a special renderer.
- **Crysis** (CryEngine 2): Sousa's layered vertex bending, physicalized breakable trees and
  palms that react to explosions, vehicles and the player.
- **Star Citizen, Planet Tech v5 (Nyx and later)**: rule-based GPU scattering with competition
  for water, nutrients and light; distant forests from ground-cover data; touch bending was in
  R and D. Its strength is the ecosystem layout at planet scale, which our placement already
  follows.
- **Horizon Zero Dawn / Forbidden West**: SpeedTree plus Houdini, skinning approximated in
  vertex colours, 3D wind textures in camera cascades, geometry grass, depth-prepass for
  alpha, separate shadow meshes.
- **The Witcher 4 (UE 5 demo)**: the scale reference above: modelled leaves, bones on GPU,
  voxels far, Mega Geometry for ray tracing.

## 7. Proposed design

One generator, three stages per tree, everything deterministic from (species, seed, age).

1. **Growth (`TreeSpecies` resource, `TreeGenerator`).** Self-organizing growth after
   Palubicki 2009 with Stava 2014's parameter set: buds, a voxel shadow grid for light, the
   Borchert-Honda resource model, gravitropism, phototropism, shedding. Optional environment:
   neighbours (forest-grown versus open-grown), terrain slope (lean), prevailing wind (Pirk
   2014 rest-pose drift: flagged crowns at coasts and tree lines), a clip envelope (hedges).
   Output: a branch graph with radii (pipe model, da Vinci's rule), age and vigor.
2. **Meshing.** Generalized cylinders with welded collars at junctions and a flared root base
   (strands from Li 2024 later, as an upgrade for hero trees if the collar looks short of the
   bar); bark UVs continuous along the stem; procedural bark textures and real displaced bark
   on LOD 0; leaves as modelled geometry from the `PlantGenerator` leaf baker, clusters with
   OMMs on far LODs; season and snow parameters on the materials (snow_enabled on crowns).
   LODs: twig pruning plus stochastic pruning of leaves (Cook 2007), fewer radial sides, then a
   coarse mesh with cluster cards; never a flat billboard.
3. **Rig and wind.** A skeleton of trunk plus one or two branch levels (Witcher 4 style rigid
   parts, about 20 to 60 bones a tree), per-bone Habel 2009 beam response to `WeatherMap3D`
   wind (mean, gusts, canopy sheltering), solved in one compute pass that writes
   `bones_per_instance` records; a few dozen unique skeletons per species with orientation
   variants share solves. Leaves flutter through the twig bones, so the path tracer sees it.
   Far trees hold their pose (scheduler).

Plug-in points, agreed with the vegetation side: each tree species is a `PlantSpecies` whose
meshes are generated variants, listed first in the Biome; `canopy_radius` and
`canopy_opacity` come from the grown crown (crown mesh origin at ground level, since
`canopy_top` is read from mesh 0's AABB); climate ranges give altitude belts and tree lines;
trees carry no colliders on `SnowCover3D.ground_collision_mask`. Generated variants are cached
as resources at edit time (binaries to Gitea LFS) or rebuilt deterministically on load.

## 7a. Collision and touch

Asked for on 10 Nov: vegetation should react to bodies, not only grass.

How others do it:
- **CryEngine (Crysis, Kingdom Come).** Trunks carry simple physics proxies (cylinders or
  capsules) and stop characters and vehicles. Bushes and low branches use "touch bending":
  artist-placed chains of branch helpers become physicalized ropes that living entities and
  vehicles push aside, and that spring back by their stiffness and damping. Breakable trees
  split at authored joints when an impact exceeds their strength, and the pieces become rigid
  bodies (CryEngine docs: Touch Bending; Vegetation 04 Bushes; Vegetation 05 Trees, Breakable).
- **Horizon Zero Dawn.** Canopies have no collision, trunks are cylinders, and canopies react
  to force fields (the player, machines, explosions) written into the same wind textures as the
  weather (Sanders, GDC 2018).
- **God of War.** Wind "motors" on characters and effects add to a 3D wind field that bushes
  and trees receive (Feeley, GDC 2019).
- **Unreal 5.7 / The Witcher 4 demo.** Trees are bones; wind and interaction are transforms
  written to the bones, so anything that moves bones (a field, a contact) moves the tree.

Our design follows the same split and reuses what the fork has:
1. **Trunk and limb colliders.** From the branch graph: capsules for the trunk and every limb
   thicker than a threshold (about 8 cm), one static compound per tree variant, created through
   the physics server per instance only inside the physics radius and streamed with the tiles.
   They use their own collision layer, never `SnowCover3D.ground_collision_mask`.
2. **Touch bending.** The bone wind solver (section 3) takes contact as an extra force: bodies
   stamp position and velocity into the trample field the grass already reads, and each bone
   chain near a body is pushed out of a few collision spheres, as the hair solver does
   (`PhysXHair3D`). The same beam stiffness that drives the wind response springs the branch
   back. Shrubs, saplings and low branches react; trunks do not.
3. **Breaking.** Pirk 2014's stress test on a contact impulse snaps a branch or a sapling: its
   bones are frozen and the part becomes a PhysX rigid body (Blast for trunks later). Felled
   trees and logs are PhysX bodies with the same capsules.

### 7b. As built

`TreeGenerator.get_collision_capsules()` (also the mesh meta `tree_colliders`): wood thicker
than `collider_radius` (8 cm) in capsules of up to 2 m. `TreeWind3D` gives instances within
`collision_range` a static body of those capsules on `collision_layer`, through the physics
server (PhysX when that is the server). Nodes in `touch_group` push the bones they reach out
of their sphere; each bone yields by `touch_stiffness` over its own stiffness, so twigs and
shrub stems give way and trunks do not, and springs back on its own frequency, more damped than
in free sway (leaves rub). A body faster than `break_speed` that bends a branch thinner than
`break_radius` past about 35 degrees snaps it: the bones collapse on the tree and the branch,
cut from the tree's mesh, becomes a RigidBody3D thrown with half the body's speed. Grass under
the tree still reads the trample field as before.

## 8. Stages

1. Growth model and species table (oak, beech, birch, Scots pine, Norway spruce, hazel,
   hawthorn), with a bench that grows each species open-grown and forest-grown, and timings.
2. Meshing with junction collars, bark and leaves, three LODs, raster and path traced 100%
   crops against the stand-ins.
3. Skeleton and GPU wind solver over instance bones, with the weather wind.
4. Shrubs, saplings, hedges, and deadwood decay classes plus PhysX logs; trunk and limb
   colliders, touch bending through the bone solver, breaking.
5. Hook into `VegetationField3D` (real trees replace stand-ins, canopy from the grown crown)
   and the showcase forest.
6. Scale on the PC: RT LOD sharing, OMM cost, partitioned TLAS, bones-in-view budget.

Needs the PC (no GPU or denoiser in the cloud): GPU timings of the wind pass and of leaf
geometry versus OMM cards, denoised path traced crops at 100%, and the forest-scale bench.

## 8a. Species, habitats and stands (as built)

Seventeen presets: oak, beech, birch, Scots pine, Norway spruce, hazel, hawthorn, small-leaved
lime, sycamore, ash, horse chestnut, black alder, white willow, larch, silver fir, rowan, elder.

**Habitat.** Each preset has a climate envelope from the species range maps and climate profiles
of the European Atlas of Forest Tree Species (San-Miguel-Ayanz et al. 2016): annual and January
mean temperature, the dry end of precipitation and the aridity index, slope, soil depth, and for
alder and willow the distance to water. `apply_habitat()` writes them as `PlantSpecies` rules
with soft edges (1.5 C, 3 C, 150 mm). Only the dry end of rainfall limits: the wet ends of the
range maps are cold or oceanic climates the temperature rules already cover (the first version
capped rain and emptied a wet mountainside).

**Stand-grown and open-grown.** The stand-grown form grows with `forest_shade` among neighbours
at 1.3 times the stand spacing (the mean nearest-neighbour distance of a Poisson-disk pattern),
with side shade past half that distance at every height up to the tree top: Palubicki's trees
grown in one grid meet at a shared boundary, and the stand form now does too (crown radius about
0.65 of the spacing, so the canopy closes). The open-grown form keeps to light gaps and edges
through a shade rule (Ellenberg light value). Crown radius is the drip line, the 95th percentile
of foliage reach, not the longest twig.

**Stands** (Ellenberg 1988; EUNIS G1-G3 and FA): beech (with sycamore and ash in complementary
patches); oak-lime with ash in moist hollows and a hazel coppice layer; montane spruce-fir-beech
(1.5 to 6 C annual mean); subalpine larch-spruce up to the tree line (-1.5 C); pine heath
(under about 750 mm); riparian alder, willow and elder; hedgerow (hawthorn, hazel, elder, rowan
with oak, lime and horse chestnut standards, placed by the scene along its lines). In each:
canopy trees, then open-grown trees in gaps, then shrubs under their shade limits.
`make_woodland()` joins the woodland stands with every canopy tree first; later stands' trees
take only gaps earlier crowns leave, so overlapping belts form ecotones instead of stacking.
Bench: `docs/bench/trees -- --stands --test | --map= | --region= | --plot=N`.

**Foliage through the crown.** Open-grown trees keep leaves down to the lower branches: a weaker,
deeper shadow (strength 0.08 over 4 cells) and a third of the old shedding. Short shoots (spurs)
on wood under 30 years and 12 cm thick carry leaves wherever Beer-Lambert light exp(-shadow)
stays above 2%; they are added to the mesh after growth, since letting them shade during growth
collapsed crowns to poles. Twigs leave in all directions and some fork; leaf normals follow a
spherical-like inclination (Campbell 1986). Holly, yew and box form the evergreen understorey
(holly kept to January above -1.5 C, Iversen 1944).

**Leaf area budget.** One internode stands for a twig system, which put an open oak near leaf area
index 17. Whole twigs are now dropped at random to at most LAI 5.5, the temperate broadleaf mean
(Breda 2003; Asner et al. 2003); leaf size stays true. Open oak: 442k leaves, 7.7M triangles
(was 1.49M, 23.6M). `get_leaf_area_index()` reports it. The hero mesh is still millions of
triangles; LODs and leaf clusters are stage 2.

**Stand-grown form, second pass.** Stand trees poured all vigor into the leader (beech 39 m,
sugar maple 36 m at 50 years) with a crown a few metres deep. `leader_growth` caps the metres any
shoot adds in a year (0.6-0.7 for beech, oak and maples, 0.75-0.9 for white pine, spruce, larch
and birch). Capped, they turned broom-shaped instead: low limbs of the open sapling climbed to the
canopy, because the stand was modelled at its final spacing from the first year. The stand now
starts dense and thins as it grows, spacing a quarter of the top height (Hart-Becking index 20-30%;
Wilson 1946) up to the mature spacing, so lower limbs are shaded out early: forest beech clear
bole 0.6 m to 5 m, sugar maple 13 m (`get_bole_height()`). Leaves are now thinned first where they
crowd, to 1.5 m2 of leaf per m3 (Lalic and Mihailovic 2004), then to the crown's LAI, and by twigs
and leaves in equal parts, so the dense top shell thins before the sparse inner crown. Conifer
buds no longer die of shade (crowded young whorls under the tip left a bare band); they go only
by shedding. `get_foliage_profile(bins)` gives foliage reach per height slice for checks. Stand
crowns then held leaves only in their top few metres: buds were dying of shade a few metres under
the top (light below 0.05 in the linear model). Buds now die only in full darkness, as shade-
tolerant buds live on a few percent of open light (Larcher 2003), and weak branches still go by
shedding: forest beech crown depth 2.6 m to 8 m, open oak foliage from 2.8 m.

**LODs (stage 2, first part).** Each surface carries three index LODs that Godot picks per
instance by screen error (0.05, 0.2, 0.8 m): bark drops tubes under 1, 3 and 8 cm; leaves are
stochastically pruned to 50, 15 and 4%, survivors enlarged by 1/sqrt(keep) about their base so
the leaf area holds (Cook et al. 2007), each level a subset of the one before. Real leaves at
every level, never cards; the path tracer uses LOD 0. Open oak 7.4M triangles, then 3.0M, 1.1M,
0.3M; at 60, 250 and 600 m the LOD and full meshes look the same (lod_oak_60_250_600m.jpg).
Enlarged copies add about 70% to the leaf vertex buffer. Needles: a spruce is 9.8M needle
triangles and 53M vertices with LOD copies. Paulo's pick (11 Nov): real needles near, sprays
far. `needle_sprays` draws each shoot as two crossed sprays with a generated needle image
(SpeedTree-style fronds), hashed alpha with alpha to coverage (Wyman and McGuire, I3D 2017) and
coverage-preserving mips (Castano 2010): a 0.5 alpha cut made far sprays vanish once mips
averaged below it. Spruce 53M to 7M vertices; at 55 m as full as real needles. Stand and
woodland species always use sprays; `generate()` keeps real needles for a tree near the camera.
Under the path tracer the sprays want opacity micromaps (PC check).

**Eastern North America** (Paulo's pick, 11 Nov). Sugar and red maple, northern red and white
oak, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, American beech, paper and yellow birch, witch-hazel and
mountain laurel. Each starts from its nearest European relative's growth rules and changes habit,
leaf size, bark and colour. Climate envelopes from Silvics of North America (Burns and Honkala
1990) where it gives figures, otherwise the USGS percentile atlas (Thompson et al. 1999). Stands
follow the SAF forest cover types (Eyre 1980) and Braun's forest regions (1950): northern
hardwood (sugar maple, beech, yellow birch, hemlock on moist ground), eastern oak (white and red
oak, red maple, mountain laurel thickets) and pine-hemlock. `make_woodland(variants,
REGION_NORTH_AMERICA)` joins them; the bench region map takes `--na`. Birch crowns were also too
wide (radius 12.8 m on a 23 m tree): `lateral_extension` 0.65 brings that to 7.

**Conifer cones.** Open-grown conifers spread too wide (spruce 39 m across). Scaling bud vigor
on branches starved the crown and it collapsed to a pole; scaling shoot length alone
(`lateral_extension`) narrowed it but left the young upper branches as stubs, so the top half
looked bare. What holds now is `crown_cone`: a branch reaches at most that many times its depth
below the leader's tip (Kantola and Makela 2004: spruce branch length grows with depth in the
crown, the crown keeping its shape). Shoots that would leave the cone wait for the leader, so
upper branches grow at full rate but stay short. Spruce and fir 0.3, larch and hemlock 0.35,
Scots and white pine 0.45, with a lighter self-shadow so the denser crown keeps its buds. Open
spruce: 33.6 m tall, crown radius 8.7 m, branches to the top; forest forms crown 3 m, base near
20 m. `lateral_extension` stays for broadleaves (birch 0.65). The bench renders with 8x MSAA:
needles are millimetres wide, and without multisampling they missed every sample and conifers
read as sticks; games run TAA or DLSS, which integrate that coverage.
